# Freshbot
Starcraft 2 AI
The basic goal with this project is to learn coding in Python as well as
working with APIs while working with a game that I am very familiar with

Terrantestbot is a basic Terran that makes marines and medivacs and then pushes
into the enemy base when a certain number of marines are available.

Currently refactoring my old code from the [DEAD FORK](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) into the [ACTIVE FORK](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2).

The next challenge is figuring out how to get an upgrade started (Stimpack).
Once I figure this out I plan on adding +attack and +armor upgrades to it as well.
The final bot will just mass marines and medivacs with upgrades and
possible drop harass if I feel like working on Terran more.

Freshbot will be an advanced Zerg and my main focus

Plan is for (in order of importance)
 - MAXIMUM creep spread
 - some form of early scout and defense
 - Hydra/Ling/Bane or Roach/Ravager builds based on scouted info(random if none)
